Efficient inference, likelihood evaluation, and parameter estimation algorithms are provided. Training the model is consistently ten times faster than Model 4. On three large-scale translation tasks, systems built using our alignment model outperform IBM Model 4.

@article{feng2021data,
   abstract = {Data augmentation has recently seen increased interest in NLP due to more work in low-resource domains, new tasks, and the popularity of large-scale neural networks that require large amounts of training data. Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still relatively underexplored, perhaps due to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of language data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate additional work in this area. We also present a GitHub repository with a paper list that will be continuously updated at https://github.com/styfeng/DataAug4NLP},

@report{sardianos2015news,
   abstract = {Argument extraction is the task of identifying arguments, along with their components in text. Arguments can be usually decomposed into a claim and one or more premises justifying it. The proposed approach tries to identify segments that represent argument elements (claims and premises) on social Web texts (mainly news and blogs) in the Greek language, for a small set of thematic domains, including articles on politics , economics, culture, various social issues, and sports. The proposed approach exploits distributed representations of words, extracted from a large non-annotated corpus. Among the novel aspects of this work is the thematic domain itself which relates to social Web, in contrast to traditional research in the area, which concentrates mainly on law documents and scientific publications. The huge increase of social web communities, along with their user tendency to debate, makes the identification of arguments in these texts a necessity. In addition, a new manually annotated corpus has been constructed that can be used freely for research purposes. Evaluation results are quite promising, suggesting that distributed representations can contribute positively to the task of argument extraction .},

The ability to engage in argumentation is essential for humans to understand new problems, to perform scientific reasoning, to express, to clarify and to defend their opinions in their daily lives. Argu-mentation mining aims to detect the arguments presented in a text document, the relations between them and the internal structure of each individual argument. In this paper we analyse the main research questions when dealing with argumentation mining and the different methods we have studied and developed in order to successfully confront the challenges of argumentation mining in legal texts.},
